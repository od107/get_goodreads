## current version
A small script to 
1. get the titles of the files in a folder and clean thmem so they are somewhat uniform
2. Use this list to fetch the score from the goodreads search list page
3. save the result to a csv


## improvements to be done
- make sure that we do not select the score from the book summaries
- navigate to the actual book page to get extra info such as tags
